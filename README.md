# Solidus Product Description Editor

Adds a WYSIWYG editor to the product description field in the admin.
Presently [CKEditor](http://ckeditor.com/).

**Note:** The CKEditor files are accessed from a CDN and not bundled into the gem.
If you're paranoid about remote javascript, perhaps give it a miss.
